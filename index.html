            <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Biometric authentication has emerged as a cornerstone technology for secure identity verification, with growing importance in mobile security, border control, and banking. However, biometric systems face significant security and privacy challenges, including spoofing attacks, privacy preservation, and template protection. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss recent advancements, challenges, and emerging trends in biometric authentication and security. The event aims to facilitate interactions among academics, industry professionals, and policymakers, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

            <h3>Title: Cryptography and Biometrics: Past, Present, and Future</h3>
            <h3>Speaker: John Karabin</h3>
            <p>
            This talk will explore the evolution of two transformative technologies from the 1980s to today. I’ll examine how modern cryptographic algorithms and platforms have advanced, and how biometrics transitioned from classified research labs to everyday use on mobile devices. The discussion will highlight the growing convergence between these fields, the widespread adoption of both technologies, and the regulatory frameworks shaping their use. Finally, we’ll look ahead to predict emerging trends and challenges that may define the next chapter in cryptography and biometrics.

        <h3>Title: Dark Web to Deepfakes: Defeating Biometric Authentication</h3>
        <h3>Speaker: Pouya Ghotbi</h3>

        <p>
            Biometric authentication faces a sophisticated adversary ecosystem operating with industrial efficiency.
            This talk exposes underground infrastructure defeating facial recognition, fingerprint scanners, and
            multi-modal systems through attack commoditization, data trafficking, and adversarial machine learning.
            Dark web marketplaces offer deepfake generation for $20 and injection tools bypassing liveness detection
            entirely. This "Bypass-as-a-Service" economy enabled 1,100+ deepfake attacks against Indonesian financial
            institutions and 1,100% fraud surges in 2025. Underground marketplaces document $17.3 million in biometric data sales across 720,000+ transactions.
            Unlike passwords, compromised biometrics create permanent vulnerability. Technical analysis covers
            injection attacks feeding synthetic data into authentication pipelines, adversarial ML reducing system
            accuracy from 99.5% to 1%, and deepfakes generating artificial liveness cues. Real-world case studies
            include Singapore SingPass exposure and recent financial compromises. Attendees gain intelligence-driven
            threat modeling incorporating actual adversary capabilities and defensive strategies addressing the core
            challenge: attackers innovate faster than defenders deploy countermeasures.

            <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
            
          <p>The workshop welcomes submissions under two streams:</p>

          <h3>Stream One – Peer-Reviewed Papers for Special Issue</h3>
          <p>
            Papers submitted to this stream will undergo peer review by the workshop. Accepted papers will have non-archival proceedings but may be recommended for submission to the Special Issue on 
            <em>Biometric and Cryptographic Techniques and Their Applications in Sensor Data and Network Security</em>
            (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/PD7526F8TO">Special Issue Link</a>) in <em>Sensors</em>. Special APC discounts may be available for workshop submissions in collaboration with Sensors.
           
          </p>
        
          <h3>Stream Two – Presentations without Archival Publication</h3>
          <p>
            This stream includes presentations of previously published papers, abstracts, work in progress,
            and industrial contributions. Accepted submissions are non-archival,
            allowing authors to later submit their work to venues with formal archival proceedings.
          </p>

        <p style="color: blue;">
        Due to the small number of submissions this year and to encourage participation in our workshop,
        the panel decided that after a desktop review, any paper whose topic fits within the workshop’s scope will be accepted for presentation without undergoing peer review. 
        Authors who wish to pursue the Stream One pathway are warmly encouraged to submit extended versions of their papers directly to our Special Issue. 
        As outlined in our agreement with the journal, all submissions to the Special Issue will undergo the journal’s independent review process. 
        Please note that works presented at this workshop are considered non-archival, so authors are free to submit their papers to any other venue after the workshop.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: red;">Important Notes:</h3>
        <p>
        Non-archival proceedings: This workshop has no formal proceedings. Accepted papers, abstracts, work in progress and industrial contributions in both Stream one and two
        are non-archival, allowing future submission to venues with archival proceedings.
        </p>
